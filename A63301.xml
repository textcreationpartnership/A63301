            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True ACCOUNT of the BEHAVIOUR, CONFEESION, AND Laſt Dying SPEECHES Of the Seven Criminals that were Executed at TYBURN, On <hi>Friday</hi> the Ninth of <hi>May,</hi> 1690.</head>
            <p>ON the Lord's Day the Ordinary preacht twice, on the 3d <hi>Verſe</hi> of the 147th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> viz. <hi>He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.</hi> Whence was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That Sin makes deep and deadly wounds in all the Souls Faculties, eſpecially in the Conſcience. It is a ſpreading and a deceitful, deſtructive wound, becauſe moſt men ſuffer it to ranck and feſter.</p>
            <p>Then were laid down the Recital of ſuch Sins which do moſt wound the Conſcience, and grieve the Spirit of God; and for what Reaſons Sinners muſt be ſenſible of their ſinful ſtate, before they will apply themſelves to Chriſt for healing and renewing Grace.</p>
            <p>On Monday the Ordinary inquired how their hearts were affected. They did one by one give ſome account, that they were ſenſible of their ſin and miſery. To which was reply'd, that there are many deceitful pretences on which moſt men build their hopes of Future Happineſs, Therefore I ſtated the whole method of Salvation as clearly as I could to their mean Underſtandings, and found, that as they obtained more knowledge, they grew more ſenſible of their ſinful ſtate, and more fit for the healing comforts of Goſpel promiſes.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday I required an Account, whether they did clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend the requiſite indiſpenſible Qualifications for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: But finding that they did not, I ſtared the Nature of Evangelical Contrition, or true brokenneſs of Heart for and from Sin, how this differs from mere legal Attrition in the convictions only of Conſcience without any change of corrupt Nature. Alſo I ſtated what are the Impediments of healing and renewing Grace, and urged on them many Arguments to come to Chriſt, for the binding up and healing their wounds in Conſcience. I laid down the Characters of true Faith and Repentance, that they might not be deceived with falſe hopes of Heaven. After much Diſcourſe with them ſeverally, they were diſmiſt with Prayer, and the ſinging of a penitential <hi>Pſalm.</hi> I viſited them every day till their Execution, and moſt days twice.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed to give an Account of their former courſe of Life, and or what Hopes they had for a bleſſed Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Hilgrave,</hi> condemned laſt Seſſions, and now ordered to be Executed. He confeſt that he knew the deſign of making a Mutiny in the Priſon, that they might quarrel with their Keepers, and make a forcible Eſcape. Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> and one <hi>Saxton,</hi> with other Officers, coming to quiet them, the foremoſt is ſince dead of his wounds. <hi>Hilgrave</hi> alſo acknowledged that he had been a great Sinner in ſlighting the Admonitions of God's Miniſters, for which he is now heartily ſorry. He ſaid that he repents he did not abhor and watch againſt Sin; and that tho' he ſometimes prayed, yet he did not ſhun bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which brought him to this untimely End. He ſaid he hoped God would ſhew him Mercy upon his Repentance. I ask'd him what true Faith is? He replied, It is the Gift of God, to enable a Sinner to relie only on Chriſt, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for Eternal Life. I told him that the Heart is very deceitful. He ſaid, that upon his ſearch of it, he finds that he abhors himſelf for the neglect of his Duty to God, in not hearkning to his frequent Cills of turning to him: And that if he might be ſpared, he would endeavour to amend his Life. Theſe words were a good profeſſion, but for the ſincerity of his heart, I muſt leave that to God's determination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> Condemned for a Burglary with one <hi>Elderkin,</hi> aged 32 years, bred a Clothworker, in <hi>Penny ſtone</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> He kept a Victualling-Houſe in <hi>Kent ſtreet.</hi> He ſaid he had many ways ſinned againſt God. I askt him wherein? But he did not declare expreſly in what Particulars, I told him, tho' he hoped Chriſt dyed for his Sins, yet he would not waſh away the guilt and defilement of any Sin, where it is not an heavy burthen on the Conſcience. If it were ſo, he would take the ſhame of them, and acknowledge his Vileneſs in a more free and ingenuous manner. At laſt he ſaid, that he had been very diſobedient to his Parents, and that he had waſted their Eſtate to their great Damage and Grief: But that he will endeavour, to the utmoſt of his knowledge, to beg of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Grace, and to ſettle his Soul-ſtate, that his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may tend to a thorow Converſion in hating every evil work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Mawn,</hi> condemned for ſtealing a Bay Gelding, was very penitent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Column,</hi> condemned for breaking open the Houſe of one <hi>Thomas Baker</hi> of <hi>St. Mary le Bone,</hi> was likewiſe penitent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonas Ratcliffe</hi> Condemned for the ſame Crime, Aged 21 Years, Born in <hi>Cripplegate-Pariſh,</hi> bred up to the Trade of a Butcher. He ſerved out his Apprenticeſhip, and lately Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf for a Soldier; he hath been Twelve Months in that Service. He freely acknowledged, that he did not Pray that God would keep him from Temptations to Sin, and bad Company. He kept not the Sabbath, but was led aſide at firſt by one <hi>Chriſtopher Jones,</hi> and others, till he fell into this Crime. He did at times Drink to exceſs. But now he ſaid, he is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all his Sins, and begs of God a change of his Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip Macqueere</hi> Condemned for Twice Robbing on the High-way, Aged 24 Years, Born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> bred to the Trade of a Watch-maker; he ſet up for himſelf, and followed the ſaid Employment for Three Years, then he became acquainted with another High-way Man, who ſollicited him to an Idle and Expenſive way of Living. He ſaid, that the Perſon's Name was <hi>Barnet.</hi> That he had been a great Sinner. That he ſeldom Pray'd, and leſs Watch'd, againſt the Temptations of the World, and the Evil Inclinations of his own Heart. But now being ſenſible of his ill Life, it grieves him that he hath offended God, and tranſgreſt the Laws. Yet he hopes, that upon his Repentance, the Lord will fit him for his Death, and make it a means to ſave his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Crawford.</hi> Aged 36 Years, Born in <hi>Scotland.</hi> He Lived with his Father 12, or 13 Years, and ſince had been Employed in Military Affairs. He ſaid, that tho' he hated Quarrelling, and Intemperance, yet he had ſinned in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; for which God might juſtly be Angry with him, to ſuffer him to fall under the Sentence of Death. But now, he ſaid, that he was ſenſible of the Evil Inclinations of his Heart, and the Miſcarriages of his Life: ſo that he is Vile in his own Eyes, and Abhors all manner of Sin. He Wiſh'd, that his Humiliation may tend and work to a thorough ſincere Converſion to God, and then he ſhall not count Death ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrew Browne</hi> Condemned for Felony and Burglary, he is Aged 30 Years, was Born in <hi>Shrop ſhire,</hi> and bred a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He followed that Employment Three Years in <hi>Red-Lyon-Fields.</hi> But leaving his Trade, and taking to an Idle Life, he fell into Evil Company, and thereby Committed the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Crime. He ſaid, that he had been guilty of Swearing, and exceſſive Drinking, of which he now Repents; chiefly for offending God, ſo that he hopes, thro' Chriſt's Merits, he ſhall make his Peace with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Rolph</hi> Condemned for the ſame Burglary, Aged 23 Years, Born in <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire,</hi> bred up to Husbandry. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that he broke the Sabbath, and was guilty of Swearing; but now he Repents that he led a diſſolute Life, and ſinned ſo long againſt God. That he will endeavour to the utmoſt ſo to ſpend his ſhort Life, that he may get the hope of being happy after his Death.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51683:2"/>
            <p>
               <hi>William Briſtow</hi> Condemned for the ſame Felony and Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Aged 23 Years, Born in <hi>Wilt-ſhire,</hi> a Farryer by Trade, but lately hath been a Soldier. He ſaid, it was his hard For<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tune to tall into bad Company. I replyed, that it was his own Corrupt Heart which led him aſide to commit the Crime. Had he reſolved in God's ſtrength to have departed from all Iniquity, ſinning could not ſo eaſily, upon inticement, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him. He ſaid, that God was Angry with him for many Secret Sins, which have brought him to open Shame and Puniſhment. Yet he was not afraid to Dye, if his peace be made with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Thompſon</hi> Condemned for Robbing a Waggon on the High way, Aged about 20 Years, was Born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but came over to <hi>England</hi> in Service with a Gentleman who fled hither for the ſafety of his Perſon, being a Proteſtant. He ſaid, he is ſorry that he left the Gentleman's Service, about a Year ſince. So falling into bad Company he committed this Crime. He acknowledged the Juſt Hand of God upon him, for that he hath been guilty of moſt Sins excepting Murther. I hope he was Penitent, as willing to take Shame to himſelf for his Lewd Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Elderkin</hi> Condemned for Felony and Burglary, Aged 24 Years, was Born in the Ifle of <hi>Ely,</hi> a Wooll Comber by Employment. After his Father Dyed he came to <hi>London,</hi> and was a Soldier under the Lord <hi>Brunkard;</hi> whilſt his Father and Mother lived he kept the Sabbath, but grew looſe afterward, notwithſtanding his Good Education. He ſaid, he did too often Swear, and was guilty of other Sins. That he hopes he now Repents, but ſaid he, <hi>It is not Crying Lord, Lord, have Mercy on my Soul, ſuch only obtain this, who do the will of their Heavenly Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Charity, I think ſeveral of them were Penitent, but the Truth of Repentance requires ſome time of Tryal, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth meer Fruits thereof. For it is difficult to break off a a Cuſtom in Sinning, ſo that a late Repentance is moſt what ſlight and falſe, as being more for fear of Death, than out of any true Love to God, or Hatred of Sin. But I muſt leave them to the Judgment of Him who only knows the ſincerity of Mens Hearts.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Fryday</hi> the 9th Inſtant, there were Eight of them put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Three Carts, in order to be Convey'd to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but being aſcended <hi>Holborn Hill,</hi> or higher, there was a Reprieve over-took them, laying Claim to the Body of <hi>Philip Macqucer,</hi> High-way-Man, which was returned to <hi>Newgate, William Mawn</hi> being Reprieved in <hi>Newgate</hi> before Execution, who was put into the Dead Warrant the Day before, the other Seven being come to <hi>Tyburn, (viz.) John Williams, William Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, James Chambers, Jonas Ratcliffe, John Thompſon, VVilliam Elderkin,</hi> and <hi>Robert Hillgrave,</hi> and the Ropes being placed about their Necks, Mr. Ordinary began to give them ſome kind and heavenly Exhortations, in order to their better and more ſafer paſſage to another world, deſiring them freely to acknowledg their former Miſdemeanors, (and Cruel, yea Deſperate Adventures,) in a continued Race of Wickedneſs and Debaucheries. To which, <hi>Ratcliffe, Thompſon, Elderkin,</hi> and <hi>Hillgrave,</hi> ſeemed with an Unanimous Conſent to adhere, the Four latter were very Penitent, eſpecially <hi>Hilgrave,</hi> who Cryed out, <hi>Gods VVill be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven, Come Lord and Receive thy Servant, who is ready to Depart, and willing to Dye.</hi> After this he gave a Paper to Mr. Ordinary, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of which was, <hi>A Cordial Letter of Good Advice, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Counſel,</hi> from the Miniſter of <hi>Chiſwick,</hi> ſent him to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> which he ſaid, did mightily affect his Soul, hoping God would have Mercy on him, for that he had wronged the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Miniſter, by ſtanding by his Bed ſide, whilſt others of his Gang Robbed him: but Confeſt withal, that he did not Injure him any way. He begged of the People to Pray for him, ſaying, that he was heartily ſorrowful for all the Evil he had done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonas Ratcliffe</hi> was likewiſe very penitent, deſiring all the Spectators to take warning by him, dying in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Elderkin,</hi> who ſtood Mute at firſt upon his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was penitent, and dy'd a Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Thompſon,</hi> for Robbing <hi>John Rothwel</hi>'s Wagon, joined with <hi>Hilgrave, Ratcliffe,</hi> and <hi>Elderkin</hi> in the Prayers and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Ordinary.</p>
            <p>Now remains ſomewhat to be ſpoken as to the other three condemned Priſoners, viz. <hi>John Williams, James Chambers,</hi> and <hi>William Column,</hi> who all appear'd at the time of their Execution to be <hi>Papiſts,</hi> tho' viſited often by the Ordinary. <hi>Williams</hi> ſpoke particularly, ſaying, <hi>That he dyed a Papiſt, and was always true to the Intereſt of the Late King</hi> James, <hi>denying the Fact for which he was condemned.</hi> The other two ſaid little, but continued pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, by turning their Faces from the other Four before mentioned. Yet one thing may be Noted, whil'ſt the Ordinary was praying with the other Four, <hi>Column</hi> ſeem'd to attend devoutly, which <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> check'd him for.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Penitential <hi>Pſalm</hi> being ſung, they were all turned off.</p>
            <p>Let every True Hearted and Unprejudiced Proteſtant, of what Rank and Quality ſoever, ſee now what kind of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Dubbed Utenſils, the late King <hi>James</hi> has to work withal, no better than Houſe-breakers, and Common Thieves, who have been fairly Convicted by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws: Yea ſuch Laws that King <hi>James</hi> himſelf muſt needs have made uſe of, for the Conviction of ſuch Cruel Miſcreants as theſe were; if he had been Seated in the Royal Throne, (which God forbid.) Theſe, and ſuch like, are the Men, that even when the Ropes are about their Necks, and juſt ready to be turned off, they will ſpit their Venom againſt the Face of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and if it were poſſible Stone to Death all the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Yea the very Civil Officers who are ordered by Law to attend their Execution were affronted, the Priſoners Dying (as it were) like Mad men, putting a bold Face upon't, as if there were no Heaven to Condemn, nor no Hell to Torment, truſting only to the deluding Vanities of a vain hop'd for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. Which the laborious and never wearied Jeſuits, and untir'd Popiſh Prieſts do always Buz in their Ignorant Ears, till they have them ſo faſt, that they can never be unlinked, from the Cunning Devices, and Deviliſh Stratagems, of that Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who has always been ſtriving to make the Nations Drunk with the Blood of her Fornications, by joining their Gog and Magogs together, to undo, yea, (and if it were poſſible,) to deceive, the very Elect, which ſuch ſilly Earth-Worms as thoſe will not be ſenſible of till they come to feel the dreadful effects of it, (in another World,) to their ſinal and everlaſting Deſtruction and Miſery, from which diſmal Sentence they can never be Redeemed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the whole Account which I can give of this Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, tho' I viſited them every day till their Execution.</hi>
